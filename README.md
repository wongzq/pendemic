Pendemic is a story-writing tool I am developing for my personal use. It also serves as an avenue for me to explore and improve my web development skills.

The name originates from the words **_pen_** and **_pandemic_**, meant to represent a writer's chaotic state of mind, and the "global crisis" of writers who can't seem to organize their thoughts into a naturally flowing story (that's me btw).
