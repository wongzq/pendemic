# **Pendemic**

Pendemic is a story-writing tool I am developing for my personal use.

It also serves as an avenue for me to explore and improve my web development skills.

The name originates from the words **_pen_** and **_pandemic_**, meant to represent a writer's chaotic state of mind.

Pendemic is still under active development. However, you can preview its current progress at https://pendemic.wongzq.com
